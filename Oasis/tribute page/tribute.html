                    Born in 1981, Mahendra Singh Dhoni belonged to a simple family. His ambition to become a noted sportsperson made him one of the best Indian captains in cricketing history. In this short essay on MS Dhoni in English, we will read about his achievements. <br> <br>


                He previously excelled in football and badminton. Later, he developed cricketing skills when his football coach sent him to a local cricket club. He became a full-time wicketkeeper of that team. He started focusing on cricket after Class 10. Since then, his career never looked backwards. His positivity won people’s hearts in every phase. <br><br>
                
                
                After witnessing his remarkable performance at the Ranji level, he was introduced to the Indian team. Seeing his cool captaincy skills for the T20 World Championship in 2007 held in South Africa, he was awarded the captain’s position for the one-day international team as well. <br> <br>
                
                
                Within 4 years, he brought the World Cup back to India after 28 years in 2011. Since then, he has won a lot of accolades across the world. He received Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna in 2007-08. He also received LG’s People’s Choice Award in 2013. <br> <br>
                
                
                Under his formidable captaincy, the attitude of the entire cricket team transformed. He is considered to be one of the greatest cricket captains of all time in the world.</div>
